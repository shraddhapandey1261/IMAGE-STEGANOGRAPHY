# IMAGE-STEGANOGRAPHY

Steganography is a combination of encryption, decryption, and machine learning that entails the art of concealing information by embedding it within various formats. This research centres on image steganography, with an emphasis on determining how image specifications affect the efficacy of steganographic techniques. To investigate the relationship between these specifications and image steganography, we have curated a diverse collection of photographs from each category and implemented a variety of machine learning algorithms. We observe that some modified images display visible changes and pixelation, whereas others remain imperceptible. Our research paper will contribute to the development of guidelines that align image specifications with appropriate steganographic algorithms, thereby improving the efficacy and dependability of image steganography.
